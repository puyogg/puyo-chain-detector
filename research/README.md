## Puyo Chain Detector Research

Requires Python v3.9

### Color Classification

Run the notebook [Dataset Generation.ipynb](./Dataset%20Generation.ipynb) to generate `dataset-images.joblib` and `dataset-labels.joblib`.

Then run the code in [Model Training](./Model%20Training.ipynb).

Once this is working, I need to go back and do some research on CVD filter compatibility.
